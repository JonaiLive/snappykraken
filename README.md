# snappykraken
My Snappy Kraken job application AKA my "Choose me, Snappy Kraken!" marketing campaign.

I've decided to add the files for the quick site I made so you - Snappy Kraken has something else to go on when it comes to seeing if I have the skills necessary to perform the job duties for the <b>Remote Data Entry Specialist</b> position. I've also uploaded the site on here for the world to see because I know there is someone out there that can give me pointers and help me get better. 

It has been a dream of mine to work at a marketing firm and I feel I have so much to learn on the technical and marketing side alike while being able to offer so much. Regardless of how this ends, thank you so much for your time!
